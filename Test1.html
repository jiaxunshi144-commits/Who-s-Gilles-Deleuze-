        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Gilles Deleuze was a French philosopher who made significant contributions to philosophy, literature, film, and art theory. Born in 1925 in Paris, he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and later became a professor at several universities.</p>
        <p>Deleuze is best known for his works exploring metaphysics, epistemology, and contemporary philosophy, often in collaboration with psychoanalyst Félix Guattari. His philosophy is marked by a rejection of traditional structures and an emphasis on difference, multiplicity, and desire.</p>

        <h2>Main Concepts</h2>
        <p><strong>Difference and Repetition:</strong> Deleuze challenges the primacy of identity in philosophy and explores the significance of difference in shaping reality.</p>
        <p><strong>Rhizome:</strong> Developed with Guattari, the rhizome is a model of knowledge and society emphasizing non-hierarchical connections and multiplicity.</p>
        <p><strong>Assemblage Theory:</strong> This concept involves understanding entities as composites of heterogeneous components forming functional wholes.</p>
